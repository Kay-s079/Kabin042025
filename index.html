    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Kaytlin, and I am now a 12th-grade junior. Welcome to my Portfolio. I created my portfolio in my webpage design class with the help of my teacher (Mr. Chagoyan). My hobbies are drawing, arts and crafts, and doing a lot of creative things. I also like to do things like doing nails and hair, and hanging out with my boyfriend. And i love cooking too, one of my favorite meals to make is chicken alfredo because it's the easiest and most fulfilling. This is now my 2nd year taking webpage design, and last year I didn't think ill like it, but I ended up loving it, and I came back to take it. Webpage 2 What I like most about the webpage is using Photoshop and using Visual Studio Code, and what I like especially like most is making HTMLs and designing them my own way.</p>

<p>One thing I learned from this class is to be patient and becoming a problem solver. And how to code and use other tools and could be useful later on in life.   After high school, I plan on going to Fresno City College and take a nursing program offered there, and get a certificate and degree in becoming an ultrasound tech. OR becoming a medical assistant. This involves doing a lot of helping and working at the front office, which I also need to type a lot, which webpage comes into play because I have experience with it already. One thing i think people underestimate about this class is it's not useful when it is, and you can learn a lot from this class more than what you or people think. From taking this class, I know how to help others and type faster because I am consistently typing.
